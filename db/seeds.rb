# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# Account.create([
#   { username: "jonh",    first_name: "John",       last_name: "Doe",     email: "Johndoe@mail.ru",         password: "123456"}
#   { username: "Alex",    first_name: "Golubev",    last_name: "Doe",     email: "alexey.golubev@mail.com", password: "123456"}
#   { username: "Michael", first_name: "Michael",    last_name: "Jackson", email: "Jackson@mail.ru",         password: "123456"}
